// script to help the user setup their own market aid instance for use if they don't already have one
// requires a private key in the user ENV via a defined API

// Needs two parts I think
// 1. A function that helps the user create a new market aid instance from scratch
// 2. A function that validates a given market aid instance AGAINST the needs of a specific configuration/strategy to ensure they have
//      the requisite approvals and balances for the tokens they want to target as well as
//      correct permissions within market aid itself
