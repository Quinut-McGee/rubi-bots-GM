# Notes
- LiquidityVenue objects should have a member that clearly denotes whether they are on or off chain
- All LiquidityVenues provide a Simple Book that should reflect the client's best guess at the current liquidity curve *for a given pair* 
- For protocols, assume that network is an input and that the protocol is the same across all networks for now
